I cannot found an easy solution on the Internet to match cracked password from hashcat (22000 only tested so far) with ESSID and MAC addresses, so I wrote this simple script.

It's far from being optimal, so PR's are welcome.

You need to have `whoismac` installed, which could be found in repo: https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools.
